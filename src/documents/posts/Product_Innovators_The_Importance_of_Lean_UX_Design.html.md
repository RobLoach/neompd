In Part Four of our [video series](http://www.youtube.com/myplanetdigital) with Michael, he explains how a lean approach to user experience design can impact the success of a digital product or platform.

Responding to customer feedback by iterating and improving the product regularly not only enhances the experience for users, but also provides significant opportunity for the product to generate new revenue. Michael also offers suggestions about pitching regular UI changes to internal executives who may be reluctant to disrupt the familiar daily experience for their users.
