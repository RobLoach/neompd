Like a great online marketer who understands that the offline world must be considered when defining a sales strategy, so must a great designer consider familiar offline concepts to assist users in completing their online goals.

Flat design &amp; [skeuomorphism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22840833) have become major buzz terms since Apple's recent announcement about the forthcoming release of iOS 7. Both approaches to design consider elements from the offline interactions we experience every day, but they differ according to a few underlying principles.

Skeuomorphism is a design style originally championed by Steve Jobs in order to assist a novice user with the most intuitive interface. It allows users to interact instinctively with an application based on their recognitive experience in the offline world.

[At WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) 2013, Apple announced that iOS7 would introduce flat iconography for the first time. Flat design supports functionality over stylistic detail, omitting things like rounded edges, shadows and gradients. For Apple, this represents an entirely new chapter in their design philosophy - something that wasn’t entirely well received at WWDC.

In a quick response, Jony Ive (Apple’s Senior VP of Design) &nbsp;stated that skeuomorphism was a introduced at a time when Apple was trying to onboard and teach users how to engage with their digital products. Today, Jony believes that people are now more tech-savvy and are ready for a flatter approach.

## But Why So Flat?

When Microsoft first introduced flat design with the release of[ Zune](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune) in 2006, there was a new element of intuitive wayfinding that was recognized by users and the design community. Although Zune wasn’t hugely successful as a media player, its flat design left a lasting impression and carried through to XBOX &amp; Windows 8. They coined the “[Metro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language))” design language, which provides “better focus on the content of applications, relying more on typography and less on graphics”.

It was evident that Microsoft did their homework. With influences from the Bauhaus era and its concept of reductionism, Microsoft was able to effectively create a popular and accepted brand. By labeling flat, solid tiles with the popular (and proven) wayfinding Swiss typography, there was a noticeable increase amongst users in regards to readability and findability.&nbsp;

Apple will likely have similar success with the introduction of flat design. In iOS 7, important apps like Calendar, Control Center, AirDrop, Mail, Weather are much more readable and intuitive due to the emphasis that’s placed on feature reductionism and increased font size.

So is this to say that flat design is better than skeuomorphism? Not necessarily. Both design concepts can actually play well together if leveraged for their strengths, and both were created to help the user. The way I see it, skeuomorphism helps makes things more usable, whereas flat design provides the user with informative direction. Combined, these two giants can become a powerful tag-team when used correctly.
