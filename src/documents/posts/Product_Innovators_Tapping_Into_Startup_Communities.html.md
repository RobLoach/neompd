[Last week](http://myplanetdigital.com/article/product-innovators-how-acquire-your-first-customers) we introduced [Vidyard](http://vidyard.com/), a successful video marketing and analytics company that got its start with the support of [VeloCity Garage ](http://velocity.uwaterloo.ca/garage)at the [University of Waterloo](http://www.uwaterloo.ca). VeloCity Garage is a part of a wider ecosystem of startup programs in Kitchener-Waterloo including [Communitech](http://www.communitech.ca)â€™s [Hyperdrive Program](http://hyperdrive.communitech.ca) and the [Accelerator Centre](http://www.acceleratorcentre.com/). After gaining momentum at the Garage, Michael took Vidyard to Silicon Valley's highly esteemed [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/).

In this video, Michael explains how communities like these can foster idea generation, motivation and an 'intrapreneurship' mentality (smaller teams focusing on one specific product within a larger organization).

In [Part Three](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxnd0aa6T24) of our series, Michael discusses lead generation and how Vidyard uses an iterative development model to constantly improve the product. And finally in [Part Four](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BseWzaFX_AE), Michael explains how lean user experience design impacts product development.
