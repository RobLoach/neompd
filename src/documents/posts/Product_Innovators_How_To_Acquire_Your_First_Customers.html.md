Kitchener-Waterloo is an interesting town. Buoyed initially by the success of RIM, KW is now the de-facto startup capital of Canada, boasting many of the most promising new ventures in the country.

Case in point: [Vidyard](http://vidyard.com/), a scrappy video marketing and analytics company that emerged from the Velocity incubator at the University of Waterloo, going on to also graduate from Silicon Valley's highly-esteemed Y Combinator program.

I made the trek from our Toronto HQ to Kitchener-Waterloo to meet with Vidyard founder Michael Litt and catch up on his company's progress. Between discussions of surfboard GoPro mounts and in-office gokarting, Michael shared some awesome insight into what has made Vidyard so successful. And since we happened to cover the whole thing with a couple of cameras, we'd like to share that insight with you!

In Part One of our three-part interview, Michael talks about how he was able to acquire his first customers and prove that there was demand for his product.

In [Part Two](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF_A9sHKG6M) of the series, Michael discusses startup incubator models and applying this thinking to larger organizations.  In[Part Three](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxnd0aa6T24), Michael discusses lead generation and how Vidyard uses an iterative development model to constantly improve the product. And finally, in [Part Four](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BseWzaFX_AE), Michael explains how lean user experience design impacts product development. Thanks to Michael for sharing his insight with us!
