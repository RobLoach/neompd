A few months back, we announced that [Myplanet was embracing DocPad](http://www.myplanetdigital.com/article/myplanet-meets-docpad-next-generation-web-framework), a next generation web framework. We were lucky enough to have the founder of [DocPad](http://docpad.org/), Benjamin Lupton, join us at Myplanet for the month of July while he helped us open source and contribute an internal project (called SaaSy) back to the DocPad community. 

Here is an update from Benjamin that highlights all of the strides DocPad made during the month of September.

**Developments**

**Documentation Rethinking**

We got a huge amount of interest in improving our documentation! [So much](https://github.com/docpad/documentation/issues) that we’ve actually put together some [criteria for documentation changes](https://github.com/docpad/documentation/issues/63) and are brainstorming [ways to improve the documentation](https://github.com/docpad/website/issues/56)and [improve the website](https://github.com/docpad/website/issues/47) as well.

**A place for requesting Trainings and Meetups**

We put together two new repositories for the community, [one for requesting meetups](https://github.com/bevry/meetups) as well as [one for requesting trainings](https://github.com/bevry/trainigns). The most requested training so far is a [Query-Engine Training](https://github.com/bevry/trainings/issues/2) so if you’d like to see that happen be sure to +1 that issue and perhaps place bounties to help it along.

**Business Interest &amp; Discussions**

As [business interest in DocPad increases](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/637), we’ve embarked on [how to help enterprise clients to see the benefits of Static Site Generation](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/634) and have created the [Go Static](https://github.com/bevry/gostatic) campaign to help facilitate that along with the rest of the SSG community.

**Sponsorship and Contributor License Agreements**

As the community grows, we also started the process of figuring out how we can best protect the community and the projects during this time of rapid growth. [Provide your thoughts and feedback here](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/635).

**Summary**

We saw huge growth this month, lots of new faces, and lots of valuable pull requests, issues, discussions, feedback, and tweets all round. Keep it up!

The next month will be focusing on refining the efforts made here with stabilising this rapid growth of DocPad and it’s community. As well as working on exciting new projects like [Web Write’s InlineGUI](https://github.com/webwrite/inlinegui), a new DocPad Website, and more abstraction of the core.

Special shoutouts go out to [Eduán Lávaque](https://github.com/greduan) for his championing in the IRC Channel as well as his [YouTube Videos on DocPad](http://www.youtube.com/user/eduantech), [Chase Colman](https://github.com/chase)for his participation in refining the community growth plans and looking into the watchr issues, our amazing and anonymous [Gittip Donators](https://www.gittip.com/docpad/) we love you!, and [Myplanet Digital](http://www.myplanetdigital.com/) for their continued financial support. And everyone else playing their amazing roles in helping this all come together.

It’s an exciting project to be a part of at such an amazing time. So thank you for being part of it, and thank you all for your continued tremendous support.

- Benjamin Lupton, Founder, [Bevry](http://bevry.me/) and DocPad.
