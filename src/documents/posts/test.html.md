### CMS-Free websites

Almost a year ago today Patrick (our DevOps Imagineer) shared an enlightening article around how Development Seed (a once very prominent Drupal based company) was now building what they called "CMS-Free Websites". [link example](http://google.com) In essence, they were using external APIs to supplement basic web development paradigms allowing for their teams to build on scalable and fault-tolerant infrastructure.

### MPLoves resource for clients

Fast-forward to December 2012 when Erin and our Strategy and Support Group were looking for something to take their pre-existing markdown documentation and get it presentable for clients without a lot of maintenance overhead. After a recommendation to use Jekyll (a static site generator), Erin and team rapidly prototyped and built what's now called our "MP Loves" collection of sites; a resource for our clients to support their engagements with Myplanet.

<div class="img_block">
	<img src="../images/img1.jpg"/>
	<img src="../images/img2.jpg"/>
	<img src="../images/img3.jpg"/>
	<img src="../images/img4.jpg"/>
</div>

Around the same time that the "MP Loves" site was being built we became increasingly interested in alternative ways to experiment and prototype without having to use Drupal, which was often for light back-end sites, setup heavy.  Coincidentally, Savvis Enterprise had an interesting interactivity challenge to solve with their network topologies and our prototyping team embraced Backbone.js to build the highly interactive site by jumping almost immediately into the code.

It felt good to build an application that leveraged new browser capabilities to work offline, save state, behaved almost exactly as you intended to and that only until recently the big boys at Google could build.

From that the idea for SaaSy CMS was born. A CMS that embraced the simplicity of static site generation that our Strategy and Support Group leveraged but also allowed for dynamic interactions that made Savvis Symphony so powerful.
