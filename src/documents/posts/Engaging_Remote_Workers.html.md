We value in-person collaboration whenever possible, and we encourage our teams to spend the majority of their time in our office. However, we have many remote team members in Vancouver, New Brunswick, Ukraine and elsewhere. These team members are critical to our success and are just as much a part of our family as local Myplaneteers.

Those who work from the office are immersed in our company culture just by nature of physical proximity. A casual joke, a smile, a compliment - these things are lost on remote workers who don't have a consistent audio/video lifeline to the rest of the team. How can we make sure they don't feel isolated?

First, we've rolled out a quarterly "Engagement Week" where our remote team members spend a week on-site at our Toronto HQ getting re-immersed in the company culture. It's tremendously effective, but, absent any ongoing efforts, the initial bump in engagement soon fades. What they really need is to experience the electricity in the air every day, and not just during our engagement week or stand-up meetings.

One of the keys to ensuring your team stays passionate is to inspire them and let them know they are valued members of the team, their presence is appreciated, and their input is valued. This is no different for remote workers; in fact, it is even more important. Sometimes you forget to call one of them in before it's too late. Sometimes a discussion just happens ad-hoc and the remote team member didn't have the chance to be part of it. That's not fair.

Most of my responsibilities as Head of Special Projects involve rolling out initiatives that live at the intersection of operations and technology. As we grow, we will continue to have a portion of our teams that are remote, and some Toronto-based team members will need to work from home from time to time. Others will have to travel to a client site and will want to stay connected to home base.

In that spirit, Myplanet is proud to announce our first **_official_** telepresence implementation.

We're not quite yet at the robotic level (see [here](http://mashable.com/2012/12/25/beam/) an example here of a telepresence robot), but one of our larger teams now has an open audio/video channel for all of their remote workers to promote serendipitous interactions and reduce the sense of isolation.

We started with Skype, but that didn't quite cut it. Even with Skype Premium it requires someone to initiate and someone to accept the call.  Calls get ended eventually or people get accidentally forgotten. Instead, we use Google Hangout and a dedicated computer connected to a big screen that has our Hangout always open with a permanent URL. It allows people to drop in and out as desired and isn't connected to a single person's computer that shuts down at the end of the day.

We'll be rolling this out to our remaining teams in the coming months, but in our minds, this is just the beginning. Imagine if you could drop in and be a part of a discussion in one of our other breakout or conference rooms the same way you could walk up to a door and walk through it. What if it was like a conference bridge with a PIN number and you could simply call in to the experience regardless of what team space it was? What if you'd like to invite a client to be part of a discussion but they are in another country or can't make it to your office?

Of course, privacy and quiet are always appreciated - rooms would be marked with whether or not they have an active telepresence connection. We maintain many breakout rooms that would be intentionally left "unplugged" so people could have a private call or alone time if that's what they need to be effective.

One thing is very clear and will always be a priority for us here: work is an activity we all love and share, not a place.  As stated in the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/), "Individuals and interactions over Processes and tools."  _**At Myplanet, people are more important than technology.**_
