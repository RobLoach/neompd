[B Lab](http://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/the-non-profit-behind-b-corps) is a nonprofit that serves a global movement of entrepreneurs using the power of business to solve social and environmental problems. They've recently released their ‘[B Corp Best for the Workers List](http://bestfortheworld.bcorporation.net/2013-best-for-the-world-worker-honorees.html)’. This list recognizes those organizations who score in the top 10% of all [B Corps](http://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps) for worker impact. We're incredibly proud to be listed here next to some of the companies we admire, such as Etsy, Bullforg Power and Change.org.

Culture is more than just yoga and a work-from-home policy... it's about team members who have opportunities to grow, a sense of ownership, and a strong set of values both here at the office and in the community. Those underlying principles have helped propel us to some of the fastest growth among Canadian private companies. At Myplanet, we're committed to creating truly usable, meaningful experiences through interaction, visual-interactive, and content strategy design on the pillars of: Focus, Transparency, Excellence, Innovation and Humanity.
