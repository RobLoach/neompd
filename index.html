					An Algorithm That Makes a Computer Paint Like a Human, Holy Fuck!
				</header>
				<img src="images/a5.jpg">
				<p>Computers are good at many things, but not painting. Creating texture, blending, shading—these are all things the human hand is very adept at doing (ok, some human hands). This his really dumb. Computer-made art, on the other hand, has always sort of looked like it was made by a machine, or at least something without emotions or a shaky handjob. While beautiful and technically precise, it often lacks in the quirks and nuances that makes the work of van Gogh, or even Bob Ross, so interesting to look at.</p>

				<p>People who use online password managers have a lot riding on the application's integrity. What are the chances of others gaining access to the stored passwords? Digital bad guys are as concerned about return on investment (ROI) as any big business. That's why they attack credit-card processing centers rather than gathering account information one credit card at a time. It's also why they're more interested in cracking online password managers instead of stealing individual passwords.

"Real life is actually, I would say, so much more beautiful and so much more rich and nuanced than anything could ever be on a two-dimensional screen, and you'll miss it if you're too busy comparing your real life to these fantasies," Gordon-Levitt told Mashable, explaining what he hopes moviegoers will grasp from Don Jon.</p>

Digital bad guys are as concerned about return on investment (ROI) as any big business.

It’s also why they’re more interested in cracking online password managers instead of stealing individual passwords.
